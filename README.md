# TTRPG Boxer

> Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Introducing **TTRPG Boxer**, an innovative AI-driven text generator tailored for tabletop role-playing games. This tool is designed to assist Game Masters by processing voice input and building upon it to create rich, descriptive text narratives to captivate players.

## Background

The project addresses several key areas to enhance tabletop gaming:

### 1. Easing the Game Master's Burden
- **Focus on Story Delivery**: Enables game masters to emphasize storytelling dynamics, thus enriching the player experience.

### 2. Overcoming Creative Blocks
- **Creative Assistance**: Provides on-the-fly idea generation to keep the game narrative fluid and engaging.

### 3. Consistent Quality Narratives
- **Professional-Level Storytelling**: Ensures a high standard of narrative quality throughout the gaming session.

### 4. Time-Saving for Game Preparation
- **Reduces Prep Time**: Automates the generation of key story elements, allowing game masters to allocate more time to other aspects of the game.

### 5. Enhancing Player Immersion
- **Vivid Storytelling**: Crafts compelling narratives that deepen player engagement with the game world.

### 6. Accessibility for Novice Game Masters
- **Friendly Assistant for Newcomers**: Offers support to new game masters, making it easier to navigate the storytelling process.

## How is it Used?

The AI tool can be utilized in various ways:

- **Voice Input**: Speak your ideas, and the AI will craft them into a unique and enthralling game narrative.
- **Customizable Storytelling**: Adapt the stories to fit your campaign's theme and tone for a tailored gaming experience.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Focus more on the game rather than the intricacies of story creation, thanks to an intuitive interface.
